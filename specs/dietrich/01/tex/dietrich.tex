Cinema D (\dietrich) specification is a table-based data model for scientific
data. In version 1.1 of this specification, we take the simplest approach to
this new model, to simplify adoption and interaction with Cinema.

\subsection{Required Elements}

A Specification D version 1.1 Cinema database is directory that contains all of
the data in the database. The directory must have the following files.
Additional files or directories may be present, but they are ignored by Cinema.

\begin{itemize}
\item a directory named \texttt{\small database\_name.cdb} 
  ({\em database\_name} is the name of the database) containing:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\small data.csv}, a Comma Separated Value file. This file is
  specified in Section \ref{csv}. The presence of this specifically named file 
  indicates that this is a Spec D, version 1.1 Cinema database.
\item optional data files, referenced by the \texttt{\small data.csv} file.
\item additional files in the directory, ignored by this specification.
%\begin{comment}
%  {\em except} \texttt{\small data.json}. If \texttt{\small data.json} exists
%  in the root directory, then this defines a Spec D, version 2.0 Cinema 
%  database. \textbf{Do not have a file named \texttt{\small data.json} if you 
%  want this to be a Cinema D v1.1 database}.
%\end{comment}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%Cinema D v2.0, which is decribed in a separate document, is an extension to 
%existing v1.1 databases that provides additional capabilities. It is not 
%necessary to read the Cinema D v2.0 specification document or implement its
%capabilities for a Cinema D v1.1 reader and writer. As of this writing,
%the specification v2.0 is currently not available for download.
