Version 1.1 supersedes version 1.0, and v1.0 files are compliant v1.1 files.
Though, v1.1 files are not backwards compatible with v1.0.  
The following are the list of changes have been made from v1.0 to v1.1:

\begin{itemize}
\item More than one \texttt{\small FILE} column can be present in the header, 
  representing more than one file per row.
\item \texttt{\small FILE} columns only need to start with the sub-string 
  \texttt{\small FILE}.
\item Data columns can be {\bf strings}, {\bf integers}, {\bf empty} values 
  (\texttt{\small NULL}) in addition to {\bf floats}. 
\item Clarification on types and {\bf string} value interpretation.
\item Removal of {\bf Type I} and {\bf Type II} distinction of 
  \texttt{\small csv} files.
\end{itemize}
