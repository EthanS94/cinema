Version 1.2 supersedes version 1.1. All v1.1 files are compliant v1.2 files,
but v1.2 files are not backwards compatible with v1.1. The following are the
changes and clarifications that have been made from v1.1 to v1.2:

\begin{itemize}
\item The first data line can contain (\texttt{\small NULL}) values, which
  means that \textbf{empty} data values can occur anywhere.
\item Clarifications made in section 3.2 under point 9.
\item Clarifications made to section 3.2.2 on data types, especially related
  to the support of \textbf{empty} values.
\end{itemize}
