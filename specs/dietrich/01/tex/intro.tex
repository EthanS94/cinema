This document is a specification for Cinema databases. It is specification D
(\dietrich), version \version. This is a different approach than past specifications
\cite{cinemaSpecA}\cite{cinemaSpecC}, but is complimentary in spirit and
function to them. This version is a simple embodiment of the new approach,
which can be easily adapted to a wide range of use cases, and is designed for
quick adoption by scientists, programmers and others.

See the Cinema website (\cinemawebsite) for additional information, and contact
the Cinema community (\cinemaemail) or the authors of this document with
questions.
