\label{sec:multiview}

It is often convenient to group cinema data bases together. This is useful, for example in the case of multi-view applications. In this case, independent databases can be collected as siblings in a higher level directory, and another json file which lists the directories can provide information about the set.

An example directory hierarchy containing the above and corresponding json file follow.

\begin{verbatim}
collection.cdb/
  info.json
  results/
    info.json /*etc as above*/
  moreresults/
    info.json /*similar to above*/
\end{verbatim}

The top level info.json here would be as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "metadata": {
    "type": "workbench"
  },
  "runs": [
    { "title": "a view of some data",
      "description": "interesting results ...",
      "path": "results" },
    { "title": "a different view",
      "description": "even more interesting results ...",
      "path": "moreresults" }
  ]
}
\end{verbatim}
