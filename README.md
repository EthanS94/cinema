# Cinema Toolkit

The Cinema toolkit has been developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, as part
of the Cinema Project.

Cinema is an innovative way of capturing, storing and exploring extreme scale
scientific data. It is a highly interactive image-based approach to data
analysis and exploration that promotes investigation of large scientific
datasets, and is easily integrated into your existing workflows through
extensions to widely used open source tools. This novel approach supports
interactive exploration of a wide range of results, while still significantly
reducing data movement and storage.

Extreme scale scientific simulations are leading a charge to exascale
computation, and data analytics runs the risk of being a bottleneck to
scientific discovery. Due to power and I/O constraints, we expect in situ
visualization and analysis will be a critical component of these workflows.
Options for extreme scale data analysis are often presented as a stark contrast:
write large files to disk for interactive, exploratory analysis, or perform in
situ analysis to save detailed data about phenomena that a scientists knows
about in advance. We present a novel framework for a third option â€“ a highly
interactive, compact and scalable way to explore data.


# Cinema components

The Cinema toolkit consists of the following components:

- `cinema_explorer`, a browser-based cinema viewer
- `cinema_lib`, the cinema python library and `cinema` command line tool
- `specs`, a set of specifications for Cinema databases
